#An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, and the day is called a leap day.
#It corrects the calendar for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun.
#A leap year contains a leap day. In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:
#The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless: The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year,
#unless: The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year. Write function to decide whether it is a leap year.
#If it is a leap year, return the Boolean True, otherwise return False

#A researcher has gathered thousands of news articles. But she wants to focus her attention on articles including a specific word.

#criteria: Do not include documents where the keyword string shows up only as a part of a larger word.
#For example, if she were looking for the keyword “closed”, you would not include the string “enclosed.”
#She does not want you to distinguish upper case from lower case letters. So the phrase “Closed the case.”
#would be included when the keyword is “closed” Do not let periods or commas affect what is matched. “It is closed.”
#would be included when the keyword is “closed”. But you can assume there are no other types of punctuation.
